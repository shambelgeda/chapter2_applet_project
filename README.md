In the Java Applet “sandbox” model, applets were strictly limited for security reasons. Two key restrictions were:

❌ No local file access — Applets could not read, write, or modify files on the user’s computer.

❌ No direct network access — Applets could only connect to the same server from which they were downloaded (not other websites or computers).

These rules prevented malicious applets from stealing data or damaging a user’s system.

2. Modern Replacement

Java Applets have been replaced by modern web technologies that are safer and more flexible:

HTML – structures the web page

CSS – styles the page and handles simple animations

JavaScript – adds interactivity and logic

🪩 Example: Bouncing Text Animation (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    #text {
      position: absolute;
      left: 0;
      top: 100px;
      font-size: 24px;
      color: blue;
      animation: bounce 4s linear infinite;
    }

    @keyframes bounce {
      0% { left: 0; }
      50% { left: 80%; }
      100% { left: 0; }
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="text">Firaol Geda</div>
</body>
</html>


This simple code makes your name move left to right — exactly like the Java Applet version, but using modern web standards.

3. Legacy Importance

Even though Java Applets are deprecated, understanding them is still valuable because:

🏛️ They are part of Java’s history and show how early web interactivity was achieved.

🧩 Many older enterprise systems still use Java-based components, so knowing applet principles helps in maintaining or migrating old software.

🧠 They demonstrate core Java concepts like threads, graphics, and event-driven programming that are still relevant today.
